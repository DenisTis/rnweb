Do not forget to switch PATH for EXPO everytime, IP address is being changed!
set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME='192.168.0.150'

Remember, "create-react-native-app", 
should use components from EXPO when possible.

Many other npm packages are outdated, or not compatible with native or
router version 4 from react.

Remember to remote all useless navigation packages..
