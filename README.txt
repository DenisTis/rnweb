Do not forget to switch PATH for EXPO everytime, IP address is being changed!


Remember, "create-react-native-app", 
should use components from EXPO when possible.

Many other npm packages are outdated, or not compatible with native or
router version 4 from react.

Remember to remote all useless navigation packages..
